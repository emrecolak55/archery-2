Game Explanation:
Game is created by the idea of distracting the patient kids. Kids love playing games both in real life or computer. With the
help of well designed images and the structure/functionality of the game it's highly possible for them to like it. You are seeing a game
which could be under the category of shooter games. It's super easy to play and there is goal like every game. With the improvoment of the game length, details
and also the new images, maps it will be a good choice to spend time on it and have fun.

There is no such UI due to some problems. Within the given time I tried my best. I have a version with main menu but I'd like to leave this version as how it is.
I hope you enjoy. I'm looking forward to implement such games on VR environment.
